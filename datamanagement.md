One of the biggest holes in how data science (and computer science) is taught is the lack of _vocational_ courses for how to use data. Most CS programs will have a database course which covers the core trade-offs around building a database -- but will only provide a cursory tough on SQL.

At USF I taught the main course on Data Management which covered both SQL (specifically PostgreSQL) as well as Python's Pandas package. The notes from this course were written up and distributed to the students.

On my to-do list is completing these notes and turning them into something presentable. Right now they are in dire need of an update (specifically Pandas has changed quite a bit from the last time I taught the course), but I've put the cover here for posterity.
