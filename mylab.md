I manage two research and educational labs at the University of Chicago's Data Science Institute, both focused on advancing data science research, education, and real-world impact.

### Data Science Clinic

I am the Director of the [Data Science Clinic](https://clinic.ds.uchicago.edu/), an experiential, project-based course where students work as data scientists collaborating with real clients under instructor guidance. Students engage in substantive projects that produce significant deliverables including data analyses, open-source software, client presentations, and formal reports. The clinic bridges academic learning with professional practice, accepting students from multiple departments and pairing them with external partners on meaningful challenges.

### Development Core

I am the Faculty Director of the [Data Science Institute Development Core](https://core.datascience.uchicago.edu/), a centralized research software engineering and data science facility that supports academic research and social impact initiatives. The Core provides research software engineering, data science, and AI services to researchers across academia, government, and industry, helping transform research prototypes into production-ready tools. Our mission includes expanding research impact, supporting translation of DSI projects to practical applications, and delivering social impact through nonprofit and community partnerships.
