| I'm now longer writing LORs for students unless I have a significant, multi-class/multi-project level relationship. Being a student in the Data Science Clinic is no longer a deep enough relationship for me to write an LOR. I've changed this policy mainly because of Generative AI devaluing LORs.  | 

If you're considering asking me to write a Letter of Recommendation (LOR) for a graduate program, please be aware of these essential guidelines:

#### Timing and Preparation
- **Advance Notice:** I require a minimum of **30 days' notice** prior to the first application deadline.
- **Complete Application Packet:** A request for an LOR must be accompanied by a full application packet, which includes:
  - An **up-to-date resume**.
  - Your **most recent transcript**.
  - A well-crafted **Statement of Purpose**.
  - A list of the **schools and programs** to which you are applying.

If you cannot provide these materials at least 30 days before the first deadline, I will not be able to write the letter.

#### Quality of the Letter
- **Acquaintance Level:** The strength of the LOR is directly related to how well I know the applicant.
  - **Minimal Acquaintance:** If our interaction was limited to a single class or academic term where you performed well, my ability to write a detailed and impactful letter is limited. Such letters are typically brief and less impactful.
  - **Extensive Interaction:** If we have had multiple interactions (e.g., you were a teaching assistant, I was your mentor, you attended multiple courses I taught, etc.), the letter will likely be more substantial and compelling.
- **Experience:** The strength of the LOR is also proportional to the experience itself. If I worked with you in a way that was not a positive experience for me such as you disappeared for a month or were just unpleasant or unprofessional these will not yield strong letters.

Before asking me to write a letter, consider whether I am familiar enough with your academic and professional achievements to write a strong recommendation. Feel free to discuss this with me for an honest assessment.

#### Considerations for Research-Focused Programs
- **Research Background:** While I hold a PhD, I am primarily a practitioner and not actively involved in academic research. This is an important consideration because:
  - **PhD Programs:** For PhD applications, especially at top-tier universities, a recommendation from an active researcher will carry more weight than one from a practitioner like me.
